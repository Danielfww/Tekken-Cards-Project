# Tekken-Cards-Project

This project may take some time (approx time estimate - 6 months);
- The idea in the beggining is to create Cards and have them flip and you have to select another similar card to make row of cards smaller and smaller;
- The second idea is to create Cards with power levels and treat them as Yugioh Cards where one beats the other (no idea how to make this work as of now)
- The idea is to create about 20-30 cards with different characters and hopefully by that time I would understand enough JS to actually make this work a little;

I will create cards for now and then resize them into one when I get the idea on how to proceed with that.
